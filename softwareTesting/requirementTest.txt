#0005 The system shall accept quadrilateral angles as floats or integers

#0006 The system shall accept questions in the form of strings and attempt to answer them
#0007 The system shall answer questions that begin with one of the following valid question keywords: "How", "What", "Where", "Why" and "Who"
#0008 If the system does not detect a valid question keyword it shall return "Was that a question?"
#0009 If the system does not detect a question mark at end of the string it shall return "Was that a question?"

#0013 When a valid match is determined the system shall return the answer
#0014 When no valid match is determined the system shall return "I don't know, please provide the answer"
#0015 The system shall provide a means of providing an answer to the previously asked question.

#0016 The system shall accept and store answers to previous questions in the form of a string or a function pointer and store it as the generator function.
#0017 If no previous question has been asked the system shall respond with "Please ask a question first"
#0018 If an attempt is made to provide an answer to an already answered question the system shall respond with "I don\'t know about that. I was taught differently" and not update the question
#0019 The system shall provide a means of updating an answer to the previously asked question.
#0020 The system shall accept and store answers to previous questions in the form of a string or a function pointer and store it as the generator function.

#0021 If no previous question has been asked the system shall respond with "Please ask a question first"

#0050 When asked a question the system shall output the question to a log file
#0051 When asked a question the system shall output the answer to a log file
#0052 The system shall output questions and answers to the log file in under 50 ms

#0100 The system shall return 'Yes' or 'No' when asked 'Is the <file path> in the repo?'
#0101 The system shall return one of the following when asked 'What is the status of <file path>?'
#0102 The system shall return '<hash>, <date modified>, <author>' when asked 'What is the deal with <file path>?'
#0103 The system shall return the repo branch when asked 'What branch is <file path>?'
#0104 The system shall return the repo url when asked 'Where did <file path> come from?'
